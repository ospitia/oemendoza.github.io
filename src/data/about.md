# Intro

Hey there! I'm Ã“scar, a PhD student in Computer Science and an AI enthusiast.
# Currently

I'm working on adapting neural IR models to domain-specific search tasks.

# Some history
I grew up in the countryside in Colombia. I developed my early career as a data scientist and a researcher there. I moved to Europe for doing my PhD few years ago.

Beyond computer science, I'm curious about music, books (mainly on human behaviour) and bouldering. Few year ago I worked on my first EP, Ode to the Earth. You can listen to it on basically any music platform, search for Little Bohemian Man.
